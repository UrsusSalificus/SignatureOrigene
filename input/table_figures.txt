    1. MDS : MultiDimensional Scaling of the distance matrix, showing how does
        the different windows approximately cluster together. Percentage of
        feature per windows also shown.

    2. Correlation : between the mean distance of each window to all other
        windows and the percentage of feature per windows.

    3. Ratios : comparing different ratios of nucleotide (single nucleotide,
        purine/pyrimidine, CG/AT and TG/AC) between windows which are the most
        different from the others according to the distance matrix, and the one
        much closer to each others.
