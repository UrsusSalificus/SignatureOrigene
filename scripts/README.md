### Scripts used for the analysis

Brief explanation of files found in this directory : 

* `CGR_functions.py`  :  all the different functions used to compute CGR
* `FCGR_PCA.R` : output a picture of PC1 VS PC2 of a set of FCGR
* `download_genomes.sh` : download all the genomes used for the analysis &#9888; TO FINISH &#9888;
*  `windows_CGR.py` : compute the whole analysis from fetching the sequence, computing CGR of sliding windows, computing
their respective FCGR, and finally computing PCA of the obtained set of FCGRs.
