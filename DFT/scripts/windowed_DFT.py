# Compute the power spectrum of the Chaos Game Representation (CGR) of a sequence,
# through the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the CGR
# Inputs:
#   - CGR :
#       - Either a file (string)
#       - Or a set a of coordinates (list) obtained through CGR_coordinates function
#   - outfile : path to the output file, which will contain the power spectrum
#           Note: if empty, will return the power spectrum instead of writing a file.
# Output:
#   - Either a file, where each power spectrum samples are separated by \t
#   - Or the power spectrum samples stocked as a list
# Performance :
#   - Takes around 1 second for a set of 150'000 x/y coordinates.
